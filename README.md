
# AI Packing List Generator

## Project Overview
The **AI Packing List Generator** is a Flask-based web application that leverages **generative AI** to create customized packing lists for various trips. By providing trip details such as type, duration, and weather, the AI suggests essential and optional items tailored to the userâ€™s needs.

## Features

- **Customizable Packing Lists**: Users can input the trip type (e.g., "weekend camping"), trip duration, and weather conditions.
- **Generative AI**: Utilizes Grok from xAI via **langchain-groq** to generate accurate and personalized packing lists.
- **Responsive UI**: Modern and user-friendly interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **Deployment Options**: Can be easily deployed locally or on **EC2**.
